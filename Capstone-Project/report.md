## Introduction/Business Problem

This project seeks to compare the amount of coffee shops between Toronto and Vancouver. Specifically I would like to learn which city has the most amount of coffee shops compared to its population and also map out the clusters of neighborhoods with the most amount of coffee shops. 

The problem here is to determine which city can be named as the coffee shop capital of Canada. Also it would be useful to identify where are the highest rated coffee shops located and any other findings that may arise from this analysis. Another interesting things will be to find out amounts of independent stores vs chains.  The audience could be residents of Toronto and Vancouver who like to buy coffee, drink coffee or work/study in the coffee shops.  

## Data

For this project I, I will use Foursquare API to identify and map all coffee shops in Toronto and Vancouver. I will also use folium to map clusters. Additionally I will use Wikipedia information with postal codes to map the neighborhoods of both Vancouver and Toronto. The focus will be on both cities itself omitting the suburbs (although that would also be interesting)
